Challenge #2 : Generate Insights to Solve a Supply Chain Issue in the FMCG domain

Challenge : https://codebasics.io/event/codebasics-resume-project-challenge

Problem Statement:

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

Task:  
Peter Pandey is the data analyst in the supply chain team who joined AtliQ Mart recently. He has been briefed about the the task in the stakeholder business review meeting. Now imagine yourself as Peter Pandey and play the role of the new data analyst who is excited to build this dashboard and perform the following task:

1.	Create the metrics according to the metrics list.
2. 	Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the 	business review meeting. You will be provided with the transcript of this business 	review meeting in comic form.
3. 	Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.

Key Insights: 

	1. Inaccurate estimation of delivery dates: If the estimated delivery dates are not realistic or based on accurate information, it can lead to delays and poor performance 	in key metrics. It may be worth reviewing the process for estimating delivery dates to ensure it is as accurate as possible.

	2. Increased demand: If there has been an unexpected increase in orders, it could be causing delays and poor performance in key metrics. This may require a review of production capacity and supply chain processes to ensure they can handle the increased demand.

	3. Product-specific issues: The fact that ghee, curd, and butter products are the most delayed may suggest there are specific issues related to these products that need to be addressed. This may involve reviewing the production process for these items or identifying any bottlenecks in the supply chain.

	4. Lack of improvement: The fact that there have been no noticeable improvements in key metrics over the last few months may suggest that the current approach is not effective. It may be worth reviewing the current processes and identifying areas for improvement.

	5. Insufficient production: If there is a significant gap in IF% for most customers, it could be due to insufficient production. This may require a review of production capacity and processes to ensure that there is enough product to meet demand.

	Overall, a comprehensive review of the supply chain processes, including production, estimation, and delivery, may be required to identify the root causes of the delays and poor performance in key metrics.
